calculator
This is a basic calculator equipped to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
and modular arithmetic. It also catches divide-by-0 errors, can do negation, and works with
decimals. To accomplish this, I used basic switch statements and onClicks applied to the 
buttons in the layout. This project utilizes a constraint layout, chains, and margins to 
achieve an optimal appearance that stays about the same when the screen is rotated.

The screenshot is in the Issues section.
